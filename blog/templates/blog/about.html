    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p class="lead text-left">
        I'm am Santhosh Kumar, a Civil Engineer who discovered his passion for machine learning in 2019 and working hard to learn it since then, especially, interested in Deep Learning.
        <br><br>
        Iâ€™m a strong believer in self-learning and as my interest in is the field, I decided to quit my regular job in October 2019 and dedicate time and energy fully into it since then. I took a couple of online courses to know inside out about this field. Andrew NG's 'Machine Learning' offered by Coursera and Jeremy Howard's 'Deep Learning for Coders' from Fastai notable among them.
        <br><br>
        It was rather tough planning for me as everything was new in the beginning. I learned Python, a widely-used programming language for machine learning and various libraries like Scikit-learn for creating end-to-end machine learning pipeline, PyTorch, a framework for Deep learning, Flask for web deployment, and many more. Apart from these, I also learned web application development and hosting in on cloud platforms. I have deployed a couple of Flask applications on AWS and my web site built using the Django framework in the Heroku platform. In that process, I also became familiar with web development tools like HTML and JQuery.
        <br><br>
        Another reason which got me in this field is that the skills I acquired will not only provide better prospects but also help me building personal projects outside of work. Stock trading is one of them.
        <br><br>
        I'm looking for Job opportunity in Data Science and Machine Learning, so if you are interested to feel free to contact me at skumarr@gmail.com or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/santhosh-kumar-choori/">LinkedIN</a>
